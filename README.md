## Bus arrival time prediction and real-time updating

### Areas Covered: 

Predictive modelling, forecasting, visualization, dashboard creation

### Introduction:

Accurate predictions of bus arrival times help passengers arrange their trips easily and flexibly and improve travel efficiency. The arrival times of buses to the bus stops will support passengers inside the bus in predicting their expected destination reach time while for the people waiting at the bus stop, it reduces the anxiety about the arrival of buses. A dashboard is a better visualization tool that can be used to display the arrival times to all bus stops by all buses in a single view. In addition, that dashboard can be updated in real-time using the streaming data. In Sri Lanka, there are no any such tool to display or produce those arrival time information. 

There are state-of-the machine learning models have been developed in predicting the arrival times to successive stops. Using one of the models, you have to predict the arrival times. Then after, you have to develop a dashboard that updates the arrival times of buses in real-time. In other words, when a bus reaches a bus stop, using that arrival time you have to update the arrival times to remaining bus stops along the route.
